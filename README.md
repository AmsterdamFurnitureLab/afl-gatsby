# AFL Website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e3c8f1d6-7779-4f41-935b-ff5851d0756d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/amsterdam-furniture-lab/deploys)

This is the Amsterdam Furniture Lab website:

* Made with GatsbyJS
* Runs on Netlify

### Todo:

#### Code
* Markdown files do not have proper internationalized routing. See [this issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60691650/adjust-slug-routing-using-gatsby-plugin-intl) on stackoverflow.
* Home picture-tiles are dynamic, but therefor lag. Make static somehow.
* Accessibility Titles: need translation as well...!?
* On mobile: clicking already selected route should fold menu.

#### Content
* Overall: Content / translation needs to edited. 
* Photos lacking resolution:
    - inspiration
    - bench no.1
