This is the Amsterdam Furniture Lab website:

* Made with GatsbyJS
* Runs on Netlify

### Todo:
* Markdown files do not have proper internationalized routing. See [this issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60691650/adjust-slug-routing-using-gatsby-plugin-intl) on stackoverflow.
* Homepictures are dynamic, but therefor lag.
* Content / translation needs to edited. 

### Current Netlify link

* Go [here](https://amsterdam-furniture-lab.netlify.com/) to see the site live.
