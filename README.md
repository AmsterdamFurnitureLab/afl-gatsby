# AFL Website

This is the Amsterdam Furniture Lab website:

* Made with GatsbyJS
* Runs on Netlify


### Todo:
* Markdown files do not have proper internationalized routing. See [this issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60691650/adjust-slug-routing-using-gatsby-plugin-intl) on stackoverflow.
* Fonts are not served.
* Homepictures are dynamic, but therefor lag.
* English seems default language.
* Content / translation needs to edited.
